# Reflection

Respond to each of the questions below with a carefully thought out reflection on the assignment.

## Question 1
### In this assignment, we used your user input to construct a small website composed of flipping cards. Can you think of a more interesting use for this basic layout? The use you describe should serve some pedagogical or research-oriented purpose for historians or humanists.

For a layout exactly the same as the one used in this assignment, asking students to help catalog research information is an option. Students could also build a small website to aggregate links to other research websites or cataloging resources regarding anything.  eg. students could build their own glossary of technical terms and share it with others. students could be asked to pick a language of their choice and build the relevant glossary of terms and definitions.

## Question 2
### This assignment asks you all to perform a certian amount of work (describing yourselves) in order to improve a project (the course roster website). What responsibilities does the "researcher" (in this case, your teacher) have to the participants (you)? What rights do or should the participants have to the end product?

Responsibilities include privacy, rights to change / edit, right to notification if the project purpose has changed (eg a private website is now public, or a nonprofit website is now commercial), right to view and freely access how a student's data is shown or used.

Right to privacy being allowed to decide how their data is used and how it is shown.

Right to change / edit to enable users to revoke or modify the data shared whenever their circumstances change.

Right to a notification of project changes so appropriate action can be taken if an agreement enacted in the past has been updated and changed.

Right to view to provide students an understanding of where and how their data is being utilized. A problematic situation would be if students were unknowingly submitting data to a private database that sorted the students by their characteristics that may allow harassment.

## Question 3
### Information in each student record was provided as a series of "fields", that is, discrete units of information separated from each other. In the use you describe above, what fields would you need to provide for each record? Can you think of any limitations or obstacles that the use of this kind of data structure imposes on your project?

A field to indicate interest in being notified about each right, a field to indicate their specific preference with regards to each right (eg a student may be ok with their data being shown on a private website but not a public one), a field to specify their preferred communication method for notifications.

Representing dates in JSON is unpleasant. JSON does not allow commenting. JSON becomes overwhelming with larger data sets and difficult to read when it spans literally across and outside the bounds of your monitor.
